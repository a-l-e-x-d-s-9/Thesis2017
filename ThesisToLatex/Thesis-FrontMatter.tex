%%% ABSTRACT_REPLACE_START %%%
\textit{Performance Level Profiles} (PLPs) were developed as a formal, quantitative language for specifying the behavior of functional modules. There are four types of PLPs: 1. Achieve - achieves internal and external goals. 2. Observe - senses environment. 3. Maintain - maintains a property. 4. Detect - detects property. In this thesis, we propose a formal way to represent all the PLPs in terms of \textit{Probabilistic Timed Automatons} (PTAs). To go beyond single module level we define a \textit{control graph} as a formal representation of execution plan for robotic modules specified by PLPs, enhanced with probabilities, conditional branching, parallel execution etc. Finally, we developed software that compiles PLPs specification and \textit{control graph} plan into a single system suitable for offline analysis by UPPAAL model checker.\\
